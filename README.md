# FarsPackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FarsPackage is to import into a dataframe the US National
Highway Traffic Safety Administrationâ€™s Fatality Analysis Reporting
System (FARS) data and summarize them with a plot per state.

- Read in data with fars_read
- Create file name path with make_filename
- Read in data based on year with fars_read_years
- Summarise data with fars_summarize_years
- Plot data by state with fars_map_state

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
